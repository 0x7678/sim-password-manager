SIM Password Manager
====================

Android password manager app that implements password encryption inside a 
secure element (SE). Can only run on a device that supports the Open Mobile API 
(aka SmartCardService). Requires associated Java Card applet to be loaded in 
the SE (SIM card or embedded SE) in advance.
